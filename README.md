**This mod ONLY works on DEDICATED SERVERS and does nothing in co-op/singleplayer**

**WARNING: This mod will SHUT DOWN the server - currently there is no way to RESTART the server from a mod, so please make sure you are using a daemon that will automatically restart the server when it shuts itself down**

Don't you hate it when you try and join your server and it disconnects telling you there are outdated Workshop mods? Hate no more thanks to Update PLZ!

This mod will query the server's Workshop mods every minute and check if they were updated after the server started up. If it detects outdated Workshop items, the server will be saved & restarted the next time it is empty.
